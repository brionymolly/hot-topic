                <h2>How does Rancière interpret the abstract schools of 1910s and 1920s Russia, in Regards to the Shortcomings of the Notion of Modernity? </h2>

                <p class="float-none">
The abstract rule of Russia lasted almost two decades, spanning from the mid 1910s to the beginning of the 1930s, where the movement was destroyed by Stalin’s laws for only Union Realist Artists, thus throwing the Constructivist, Futurist and Suprematist movements, back into the realms of abstract modernity . Throughout these years however, development of what is seen as impossible according to some theories, flourished in a new abstract state of politics, art and mind. 
<br><br>
This essay will discuss the politics of art, in the styling of Rancière’s Politics of Aesthetics with discussion of regimes, and what constitutes as ‘art’. There will also be a short contextual introduction to the timeframe, popular artistic genres of the time as well as the Russian artists, Vladimir Tatlin, Kazimir Malevich and Aleksandr Rodchenko and their movements of the avant-garde. In analysing the following works, use of the Ethical, Representational Aesthetic regimes outlined in the first paragraph will be used. In addition, analysis of each genre in context to Ranciere’s Politics of Aesthetics shall be discussed and whether the notion of modernity is applicable to the avant-garde in each represented artist.
Overall, it shall be seen that not all regimes are applicable to the abstract of modernity, and can be applied in different aspects than they are written. There will also be conclusion that the time discussed is unique in the sense that abstract became convention and therefore breaks conventional theory.

<br><br>
In analysing art in Rancière’s Aesthetics in Politics, the initial notion discusses the fine arts. Within this, there is outlines three main regimes that contribute to the analysis in regards to the relation of aesthetics and politics. In the Ethical Regime, as outlined by Plato in looking at sculptures, art or the sculpture in this case, “is gauged against the question of truthfulness and copy .”  This leads to the analysis of aesthetics, not as a discipline as previously presumed, but as a particular regime of identification of art. The particularity regards to the social and historical context that identifies art, therefore meaning art cannot exist as an abstraction, due to the tributary to the way different points of time and social regime perceive it .  The second regime outlined by Rancière is Representational. Within this regime, art is regarded within the hierarchy of genre, as well as in relation to qualities, for example competence and skillfulness between the subject and the representation. In this regime, the art is made visible by the subject matter and the autonomy of the piece itself in correlation to other pieces present within the social regime .  Lastly the Aesthetic regime, that due to the notion of abstraction and modernity, can no longer assign art a particular place within society, nor be defined by the skill and practice. Instead, Aesthetic regime evolves the analysis of the ‘fine arts’ to simple ‘art ’. In a way, this new form of Aesthetic regime causes a paradox in which two strains of political relation coincide. The first is that of the politics of the ‘becoming of art’ (le devenier vie de l’art) in which the aesthetic experience portrayed coincides with other forms of experiences. The second being the politics of the ‘resistant form’ (la forme resistance), that shows “the political potential of the aesthetic experience ” as derived from the separation of art from other forms of experience.  In regards to the avant-garde and modernity in art that is seen in the twentieth century, both lines of the aesthetic regime can analyse the schools of abstract in correlation to politics, society and historical context. 
Previously, modernity and avant-garde have not been intuitive in terms of aesthetics and politics, due to the confusion produced in the relation to a specific regime of the arts and the refusal of continuity in regards to reflecting the past and or anticipating the future . Therefore, the Aesthetic regime fails to identify different schools of art that can be considered under the bracket of modernity and avant-garde, no matter the difference in skill, style and concept. 
<br><br>
	During the 1910s and 1920s, avant-garde movements appeared across Europe, with Western culture embracing Cubism from artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Cubism arguably being the gateway to ‘modernity,’ in the sense that the art is no longer about an external subject matter, but an expression of itself as art . With the increasing popularity of experimental art forms and the appearance of new and exciting styles and artists, as well as the rise of radical politics, war and general unrest in Europe, the 1910s and 1920s in particular becomes an interesting couple of decades to analyse, in regards to the art as well as the politics. In Russia, Cubism was not at the forefront of avant-garde artistry, with Suprematism and Futurism being the main constructs of the abstract. Pioneers of Russian avant-garde, before the October Revolution, consisted of Malevich and Tatlin. These two became contributing influencers to Constructivism and the main artists steering the new aesthetic policies of the state after 1917 . Tatlin was the creator of a new expressive idiom whereby three dimensional reliefs and counter reliefs depicted the innovative assemblage of randomly assorted everyday industrial objects and materials. Proclaiming autonomy to any avant-garde collective, including ‘Tatlinism,’ retrospectively, Tatlin’s work categorizes under the early constructivist bracket. Malevich, however, pioneered the Suprematist scene, focusing on basic geometric forms and lines, such as squares, rectangles and circles, presented in a limited range of colours (See Fig 4 ). The influences of these artists formed one of the main pillars of Russian Artistry as ‘Young’ or ‘Left’. Split into three federations, Russian artistry followed ‘Young’, ‘Centre’ and ‘Senior’, as referenced as ‘Left’, ‘Centre’ and ‘Right ’.  The ‘Leftists’ were the non-objectivist artists, including the Futurist, Cubist and Suprematist genres. This group was the first to align with the Bolshevik regime. This gave them “the greatest opportunity they would have for involvement in the creation of the new world .” The ‘Centre’ consisted mainly of the World of Art movement and the Union of Russian Artists (sociuz russkilek khudozhnikov), entailing the groups such as The Donkey Tail and the Knave of Diamonds . Lastly, the ‘Rightists’ made up of the conservative painters of the Union of Russian Artists and the Wanderers (Peredvizhnuiki) who focused on the realist approach to painting .  Due to the nature of the October Revolution in 1917, the influence of the ‘leftists’ escalated. Due to the political nature of art by Tatlin and Aleksandr Rodchenko, the new socialist movement fuelled avant-garde art, to the extent that it entered the normal Russian paradigm, thus creating the image of ‘the Russian experiment in art’ throughout the latter part of the 1910s into the 1920s.

                <h2>To what extent does the cenotaph in London relate to Rancières 'distribution of the sensible' and the desensitisation of war? </h2>
                <img class="float-left" src="../img/memory.jpg">
                <p class="float-none">For centuries, war has been an integral part of our out political climate. Clausewitz himself, amongst other famed military strategist throughout the ages, defines war as a continuation of politics . However, in war, individuals lose their autonomy from the governing system and therefore lose their individual identity in the mass of war and politics. The cause to remember those who become lost in the system of war in mass formation generally became apparent after the Great War, later known as the First World War from 1914-1918. 
This Essay will examine Rancière’s Distribution of the Sensible along with his other relevant writings on Politics and Identity and how it’s discussion is relevant to the apparel of the London Cenotaph throughout it’s existence to the present. There will also be a short narrative on the appearance and establishment of the Cenotaph in Whitehall as well as the politics in and around it is presence and survival. Another integral argument of this discussion is also the idea of trauma and how it presence effects the continuation of the political over time as a social aspect.
Overall, the arguments put forward by Rancière apply when politics are abstract from the human condition, in relation to the Distribution of the Sensible, Trauma and Politics, Identification, and Subjectivization in the theory of the political. The integration of the human element into politics creates adverse affects causing the nullification of original theories leading to a numbed future in the understanding and acknowledgement of war.
<br>
 <br>
A usual autumn day in London beholds the mass congregation of the millions, albeit civilians, veterans, servicemen, politicians; the whole community “remembers” on the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month. Armistice Day sees the disruption of the usual day routine in London and the crowd’s throng to Whitehall to pay respects to the memorial of the unknown solider, known as the Cenotaph. Designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyen after he designed and created the wooden structure created in 1919, the marble monument shows the solidarity of the people affected by the War, being free of “culturally-specific iconography such as crosses. ” The solid marble monument also captures the aesthetics created with wars profound effects, fundamentally the high cost of human lives, giving birth to the surge of poets, painters, sculptors and other artists trying to capture and immortalise the memory of the war .  There are many other war memorials across the world, the “Arc de triomphe, Nelson’s column, the Lion of Lucerne, the Sukesalee, the crosses adorning many a little English village and the bronze plaques ” but, the Cenotaph possess something these statues and monuments don’t necessarily have. In someway, as described by John Owen, ”there were moments when it seemed that the plain, stern Cenotaph was no longer a thing of stone, but a living spirit. ” To a degree, this may only be the case on Armistice Day, with the inundating masses filling past, but also, to another extent in the eye of the beholder. The Cenotaph’s design is modest, nothing too eye catching and just another part of the ritual of Armistice Day.
The original London Cenotaph was to be temporary, constructed out of temporary materials to be in honour of the war, to disrupt the usual day for those who had lost something or someone in the war to pay their respects . To begin with, the monument designed to turn heads, jerk people’s memory of the war, realize the extent, and toll the war took on the individual, country and continent . A response to the peace marches organized in other European countries, such as France with the march ending at the Arc de Triomphe and paying respects to the unknown soldier. After the Second World War, the 1945 Armistice Day saw the amalgamation of the wars the British Empire had fought in and recognized all individuals who had laid their lives on the line for their country and empire. 
The apparel of the Cenotaph brings about the knowledge of war, but not necessarily, the emotion and disruption it initially brought about. 
<br>
<br>
 “A distribution of the sensible therefore establishes at one and the same time something common that is shared with exclusive parts .” Rancière defines the unspoken connection within communities that silently dictates our morality in the forms of culture, politics and identity. He names his definition as the distribution of the sensible, and from that explains how things peak and trough in our universal status quo.  How inanimate objects loop into this, is how they can disrupt the flow and therefore become a political issue or prerogative. Alternatively, one could say “there is an aesthetic organization at the heart of social life—an 
aesthetics that defines the spaces, places, and modalities of visibility, audibility, and so forth. ” The everyday becomes normality by the presence of things and those around creating the morale and cultural subconscious politically created communities abide by. “Having a particular ‘occupation’ thereby determines the ability or inability to take charge of what is common to the community. ” Establishing large features within a commune such as a fountain, a new building; a statue and in this instance a war memorial can cause disruption whether it be in people’s psychological affairs or in physical actions. At first, this implementation of a new anomaly becomes something to turn heads, disrupt usual behavior patterns, thought processes or even physical paths and causes the audience to see. After time, the hype of the irregularity dies down, the result being a new construct of the social norm. Therefore, after time all new constructs become somewhat irrelevant in the collective audience’s vision, no matter the extent of trauma involved.
<br>
<br>
Other relevant works by Rancière explore the social political including works on political identity as well as Politics, Identification, and Subjectivization. In this particular work, Rancière talks about communication not in any particular spoken language, but a dialect in-between to describe the ubiquitous heterogeneous contingents of the political . These two diverse processing aspects of the political are, firstly, the governing part labeled as policy and secondly, the process of equality labeled as emancipation. The second part of the political, emancipation, freeing oneself, whether it is from the paradoxical aspect of policy or from something physical or psychological, is an important manifest in the decline of sensitivity towards traumatic actions over time. 
Memory is a fickle process. In the same motion, memorialization and the want to forget balance. In traumatic experiences, we are both obsessed and repulsed by it - paradoxically attached without the commitment to truly emancipate ourselves. In essence, it is remembering to forget. In the act of remembering to forget, we are taught “the indifference of all human suffering” and that atrocities especially that of the world wars, were “not so incomprehensible as before. ” It is an ingrained factor within teaching, that we are taught specifics rather than an entirety as to preserve memory and cultivate opinion. In essence, education is set to teach how to cope with and understand experiences, whether it is traumatic or not, and how to continue with day-to-day life. In the present day, the atrocities of the World Wars are almost out of living memory, meaning that the common memory of the wars are that preserved in museums, libraries and monuments. To compare the memory of the World Wars to more recent events shows the irrelevancy of the memory, as there will always be another act of violence bloodier and traumatic than the last.  Trauma in this sense is the aftermath of an action that takes reality and turns it on end. As trauma is a product, the cause of trauma can change, usually being in a cycle, where a traumatic experience causes the consensus of trauma, and so on and so forth . The cycle overtime increases and to an extent humans are conditioned to become insensitive to trauma that has already passed, making new trauma less likely to spike outrage, instead settling into the flow of the political and social continuity. 
In this case, the trauma to cause the existence of the Cenotaph is the First World War. The traumatic outcome was the discussion of a peace parade and in the following years, a permanent monument. Arguably this is the traumatic cause for the emotional affect on the public, in the way it creates a gateway to memory and memorial, especially for the affected individual.
.
<br><br>
The London Cenotaph in Whitehall being an inanimate object does not bring about trauma in the sense of committing a violent act, but in recognition of memory. The use of memorial and in this case, the Cenotaph does not use power visual, audible of other sensory devices, it is a modest monument, commemorating an unknown soldier, “Known Unto God ” therefore lacks an individual identity. Due to the cenotaph being a staple ritual in the Armistice Day parade since it’s creation in 1919, the original affects it had almost 100 years ago now seem to blend into the asphalt being something that is done in the continuation of the social norm, a date in the diary, rather than being a disruption to the everyday. Ranciere’s distribution of the sensible correctly defines the establishment of the cenotaph, but due to the human condition the original purpose and emotion becomes nullified by time. With the gradual decline of emotion towards the monument comes a parallel decline in the sensitivity of war. Since the passing of the Second World War, the world has been afflicted with unspeakable atrocities that at first have disrupted the distribution of the sensible, but the recycled words of genocide, mass killings and murder along with the visulisations of candle lit sermons, monuments and exhibitions bring about a comprehendible understanding rather than emphasizing the brutality of war’s existence. As time goes on, trauma is less traumatic with the visual impediments we have erected to help the communities cope with conflict rather than relish in the traumatic aftermath.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the Cenotaph in London is only a contribution to the societal desensitisation of war, although as a monument is a consistent and solid presence in the memory of the concept of war, not the memory of the war itself. Other major factors such as the cyclical effect and affect of trauma over time, as well as the application of remembering to forget, a prominent teaching we see throughout society, not just on the topic of war, contribute to the general decline of horror on the topic of violence and conflict. Rancière has created an explanation for how our society functions and copes with anomalies but does not acknowledge fully how a concept can be eroded by time to become a social normality, in this case the existence of war being an accepted ‘commodity’ within our social structure.

                <h2>How did the Vietnam War demonstrate the Limits of US Military Power?</h2>
                <img class="float-left" src="../img/war.jpg">
                <p class="float-none">American involvement in Vietnam spanned twenty-five years. Initially starting out as financial aid to a French colonial war, U.S. presence escalated to a committed land war that saw high casualties, unrestricted media and conflicting strategy. 
                <br><br>
This essay will discuss the three main theatres of war: Land Air and Sea, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses in each area. In Land there will be discussion on reliance on conventional strategy as well as tackling the main obstacles Americans faced in the land war against the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong. In particular looking at Lyndon Baines Johnson’s administration and General Westmoreland’s brash approach to the War with ‘Search and Destroy’ versus Richard Nixon’s Vietnam, looking at ‘Peace with Honour’ and Vietnamization.  Secondly, the discussion on Air power will look at the change of effectiveness from Operation Rolling Thunder to Operation Linebacker, looking at both Johnson and Nixon’s administrational aims and applications of airpower. Lastly, the theatre of the sea and how the naval battles in the Gulf and Tonkin and Mekong Delta operated in American advantage and disadvantage. 
In conclusion, the limits of U.S. military power are due to the lack of adaptation to a non-conventional war, lack of attention to the society and culture America was attempting to aid, and the concept that Vietnam was overall a ‘Bad War’ for the U.S. to be involved in. 

<br><br>
By 1965 under the Johnson Administration, the United States and its allies were prepared and ready to fight an attritional war by conventional means. Having preparation from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on land warfare, America was ready to fight a conventional was as seen previously in 1940s Europe during the Second World War and their limited participation of the Korean War in the 1950s. Therefore, the favorable strategy utilized America’s size, mobility and firepower of their forces in order to eliminate large numbers of enemy forces . A prominent tactic in the Johnson years (1965-1968) was Search and Destroy. Being the principle strategy headed by General Westmoreland, this intended to beat the insurgency shown by the Viet Cong, by infiltrating rural communities and weeding out the enemy. However, this tactic became very limited very quickly, as it was a conventional idea to combat a non-conventional foe. Success was measured in body count, with not all Vietnamese dead being associated with Viet Cong. Search and Destroy gave rise to the military term of ‘collateral damage ’, a way to label the excess Vietnamese dead. In Michael Herr’s memoirs “Dispatches” he relays:
 “Search and Destroy, more gestalt than a tactic brought up alive and steaming from the command psyche. Not just a walk and a firefight, in action it should have been named the other way round, pick through the pieces and see if you could work together a count, the sponsor wasn’t buying any dead civilians. The VC had an ostensibly similar tactic called Find and Kill. Either way, it was us looking for him looking for us looking for him, war on a Cracker Jack box, repeated to diminishing returns .” 
 <br><br>
Not only did this lead to a high casualty rate for the Vietnamese, both VC and civilian, but Search and Destroy also led to a high-risk casualty rate for U.S. soldiers due to the nature of patrolling through dense jungle, unable to see the enemy, who had a natural advantage of understanding the geography, climate and terrain . General Westmoreland stood steadfast to the Search and Destroy strategy that lead to stagnation of the escalating U.S. forces within South Vietnam. Lewis Sorley summarizes his presence as such:
“Westmoreland failed to advance the security of the populace or the capacity for self defense of the South Vietnam’s armed forces. He likewise failed to diminish the enemy’s combat forces despite the near-exclusive focus on that task, as the casualties inflicted were simply replaced. What he had done was squander four years of his troops’ bravery and support by the public, the Congress and even most of the news media for the war in Vietnam .” Another General could have achieved victory if they were to realize the futility of the firepower and mobility orientated strategy, and complement the North Vietnamese strategy. However considering the limits put in place by geography, terrain and the invisible enemy, America had committed to an arguably ‘unwinnable war ’ and therefore puts any general in the same position as Westmoreland as a “good general fighting a bad war .” <br><br>
In ‘The Other War ’, A more pacifist approach was taken with the idea of ‘Hearts and Minds’ being the way to win. The Combined Action Program (CAP) became a feat of counterinsurgency (COIN) operation. In this operation, U.S. marines joined ARVN  and local forces in rotary villages to capture VC . Due to the passive actions of this operation, General Westmoreland believed it was not a viable way to combat the VC, favoring firepower and mass numbers to swamp the unseen enemy, forcing the North to engage in a large decisive battle with a decisive victory . Unlike the Search and Destroy strategy, hearts and minds focused on the rural population that made up 85% of South Vietnam . Although LBJ was adamant on escalation and committing soldiers in 1965, he also believed in the Hearts and Mind strategy as a way of reinstating the self-governance of the South Vietnamese Government. However, the two strategies conflicted against each other. While the pacifist approach strengthened the relationship between the U.S. and the Vietnamese, it also benefited the South Vietnamese economy, aiding in the smaller communities, making it easier to find VC perpetrators and arms stores and gain the valuable trust of the Vietnamese civilians. The Search and Destroy strategy created refugees, distrust of U.S. soldiers and destroyed ancestral homes, farms and families .  The Hearts and Minds campaign had deep flaws, without the conflicting strategy. American assertiveness on the campaign failed to factor the Vietnamese society, in regards to the ability to transform the society to American standards, understanding the limits the CAPs had in concerns of size and scale, additionally the amount of political imbalance in the rural areas . Where the CAPs were successful, the successes were small due to the lack of commitment to the program, as well as the areas CAP were committed. 
<br><br>
Overall, the two main conflicting strategies of the Johnson Administration show small successes with capture of VC and PAVN  personnel in each strategy, but only to become futile, with the rate of replacements the VC had in comparison to the gradual escalation America was applying. 
In the ‘Second Phase’ of the war, 1969 to 1973, under the newly elected President Nixon, many changes shaped the war. The Nixon Administration focused more on the Hearts and Minds campaign with making the Vietnam War Vietnamese with a process coined as “Vietnamization”. This “transferred responsibility for South Vietnam’s defense to its strengthened armed forces, which were capable of withstanding North Vietnamese aggression .” This also meant that the start of the end was in sight, with de-escalation being hand-in-hand with Vietnamization. New MACV General Abram introduced a new strategy en lieu of Search and Destroy called “Take and Hold”. The strategy “changed the dynamic of ground warfare and facilitated a success pacification program .” This facilitated the launch of the Phoenix Program, that alike to CAP, combined the military and civilian operations to stem VC support and apprehend VC culprits. With the VC infrastructure being largely in the countryside and not wholly affected by the huge loss the VC faced after the Tet Offensive in 1968, the operations to target the peasantry and rural areas excelled in success in Take and Hold . It led to the demise of VC operations in South Vietnamese villages where the Phoenix program, Take and Hold were operating, converting around 47,000 VC to the South . 
In proving the effectiveness of Vietnamization, in 1970 incursions into bordering Laos and Cambodia to infiltrate VC camps and supply routes, ARVN forces confidently led successful missions. The Cambodia campaign is arguably one of the most successful incursions of the whole Vietnam War, destroying enemy sanctuaries bordering South Vietnam, buying America more time for pacification and leading the South Vietnamese to self-governance . Again, the success of Vietnamization appeared in the repulsion of the North in the 1972 spring offensive. Estimated ARVN losses of 8000 contrasted to an estimated 40,000 PVN and VC deaths  weakening the North to the extent that it could not form another offensive until 1975. 
Overall, Nixon’s administration showed promising land warfare strategy, but the application of a pacification orientated initiative proved too late with the fall of Saigon in 1975 to the last North Offensive. Incursions into bordering Laos and Cambodia stemmed the VC underground governance in the rural areas of South Vietnam, and Vietnamization proved successful in strengthening the South’s army and government, but not enough to get any ‘peace with honour’ or victory.
<br><br>
U.S. air power proved effective in the Second World War, implementing offensive air strategies and campaigns in both European and Pacific theatres. The consensus of all air campaigns in Vietnam followed a similar inclination in having the following three major aims. 1) “To signal to Hanoi the firmness of U.S. to resolve to defend South Vietnam against communist subversion and aggression. 2) To boost the sagging morale of the GVN . 3) To impose increased costs and strains upon the DRV  if it confirmed its support of the southern insurgency .” Each Presidential administration seemed to follow these aims, but the application of power varied especially between LBJ and Nixon.
<br><br>
Under LBJ’s government there was debate between two methods to the application of airpower, the first being a decisive and direct approach with the idea of asserting immediate and devastating blows  and the second being that of gradualism, which was the chosen method. In 1965, during the Honolulu Conference, it was agreed that demonstrative air strikes against the Communist North would implement bombing campaigns, as laid out in the NSAM-288  . Within this, Robert McNamara ordered the JCS  to outline a “graduated overt military pressure” or gradualism . However, Dave Richard Palmer, a former U.S. army officer commented that the gradual approach allowed the North time to adjust to America’s strategy and not live up to the aims America wanted to achieve. Quintessentially, the initial attack from the air could be effective, but thereafter, even with the increased intensity, the effectively of attacks would decrease and the losses would increase. 
Several air operations took place under LBJ’s administration, Operations Flaming Dart I, II, and Operation Rolling Thunder. The first attacks took place in February 1965 in retaliation to VC attacks claiming 20 American casualties at Pleiku and Qui Nhon . Operations Flaming Dart I and II operated as airstrikes on suspected VC positions, not altering VC action against the U.S. forces . After the “few isolated thunderclaps ,” LBJ initialized Rolling Thunder. Airstrikes would happen at least once a week and gradually become more consistent and focused over a gradual time. During this period Lasting from March 2nd 1965 to October 31st 1968, North Vietnam received an estimate of $2 billion in foreign aid making the American strikes futile . Combined with the American plane losses costing around $6 billion additionally the political losses, the bombings became less favorable in the United States . The USAF  also encountered heavy loses with their favorable bomber the F-105 sustaining 332 loses throughout the campaign . The use of gradualism however forceful it may be applied, failed to show success as it promised in theory.  The approach to the air operations also needs critique due to the lack of understanding of Vietnam itself, with Westmoreland approaching air power the same as the land war with more firepower would have worked .
<br><br>
In contrast, under Nixon, the air strikes became less gradual and more liberal for field commanders to choose targets and call airstrikes with more immediate response and effect. Secret bombings of Laos and Cambodia named operation Menu aided ground warfare in combatting the VC’s rural network, targeting the sanctuaries and supply routes, and incursion that was previously frowned upon due to the nature of the borders . Nixon’s first major air campaign began in 1972, named Operation Freedom Train . This looked at expanding the bombing area, pushing the neutral zone back from the 18th to the 20th Parallel in effort to coerce a peace agreement  he outlined as ‘Peace with Honour’. The failure of this operation is due to the gradualist approach of expanding the area being bombed, and not starting on a total North Offensive. Leading after the success of the ARVN in the North’s 1972 Spring Offensive, Operation Linebacker I launched. Following the Failure of Freedom Train, Linebacker I, set out again to compel Hanoi to end its ground offensive with a ceasefire and commence in peace talks. With a buffer zone of 25-30 miles off the Chinese Border , the campaign granted the USAF authority to bomb military targets within the entirety of North Vietnam. Linebacker I became a successful operation as a strategic bombing campaign, due to the North’s shift of conventional attacks following the Spring Offensive, with a heavy reliance on the factories and war-supplying facilities America had been targeting the entire war . However, success fell through with delayed promise of peace talks, leading to the resumption of the North’s, now more aggressive, attacks.  Following the success of the first Linebacker Operation, but implemented due to its failure, Linebacker II or the Christmas Bombings started on 18 December 1972, lasting 12 days . The round the clock air raids coerced the North back into a ceasefire and peace talks. 
<br><br>
Overall, Nixon’s administration used the USAF to complement the ground actions and increasing Vietnamization to a full effect. The only way to coerce peace out of the North, it seemed, was by the heavy use of force in a full out war of attrition or annihilation, which ever came first for the U.S. Operation Menu, and Linebacker I and II, showed the successes of consistent air power complementing a ground force. In contrast to Operation Rolling Thunder that saw the gradualist approach, Linebacker I and II destroyed integral parts of the North Vietnamese’s war machine in a way that led to VC demise, unable to rebuild or regroup due to the consistency and timings of the raids.
<br><br>
The third and last theatre of war for Vietnam is Naval based. Arguably, the reason for why America got increasingly involved in Vietnam, the U.S. navy played an integral role to support ground and air warfare. Mainly being used for reconnaissance and intelligence, the U.S. navy in 1964 operated on two programs, Operation Plan (OPLAN) 34A; that was advisory and logistically supportive to South Vietnamese reconnaissance, and DE SOTO; run by the U.S. Pacific Command, using U.S. destroyers to observe and locate the North Vietnamese naval forces, along with North Vietnamese radar transmitters . By August 1964, U.S.S. Maddox, while on a DE SOTO patrol, 28 miles, heading away from the North Vietnamese coastline reported to be attacked by Vietnamese torpedo boats. Due to the nature of the incident, patrols continued with an extra destroyer, U.S.S. Turner Joy. Both American destroyers patrolled the North Vietnamese coastline and a few days later the Gulf of Tonkin Incident arose, with the destroyers reporting they were under fire from more North Vietnamese torpedo boats. Naval reconnaissance missions continued throughout the conflict, defining where sea routes by the DRV were taking supplies. By 1964, research reports from the CNA  estimated that 175 to 200 tonnes of munitions and basic supplies arrived at Cambodian ports each month in logistic support to the VC in the sanctuaries in Cambodia and Laos . However, American Naval Power ignored this report and focused on reconnaissance patrols along the 1,200-mile long South Vietnamese coastline between 1965-1968. 
<br><br>The Tet Offensive in 1968, showed naval shortcomings in their lack of infiltrating the sea supplies and not intercepting Cambodia bound supply ships . 
Unlike the Second World War in the pacific, where the Americans were island hopping and engaging the Japanese in naval battles, Vietnam did not engage in a large-scale naval war. American destroyers and cruisers became support of amphibious based attacks such as Operation Starlight, shortly after the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1965 . The Amphibious Ready Group responsible for the majority of amphibious based operations consisted of U.S. destroyers and cruisers known as the Amphibious Task Force, used as support for the Landing Force of U.S. Marines. Operations that included amphibious based landing and naval support acted in areas such as the Dodge City and Go Noi Island, with various operations such as Meade River in 1968, Pipestone Canyon. The Barrier Island region saw amphibious marine operations such as Daring Rebel and Defiant Stand in 1969. Additionally, the Delta provinces of Dinh Tuong and Kien Hoa saw amphibious action from U.S. and Korea in Operation Speedy Express . These operations proved successful in driving out PAVN and VC forces, but never holding them as months later the PAVN regained the areas. Between 1965 and 1969 62 landing operations took place , not all were successful but they became valuable training for U.S. marines, keeping the art of amphibious landings alive and updated in accordance to new combat and training environments . Operations such as Double Eagle in early 1966 showed the carefully planning and application of amphibious forces to no avail due to PAVN knowledge of the assault .
In coalition with the USAF under the Nixon administration, air and sea incursions into North Vietnamese and Cambodian coastal territories to penetrate supply routes became apparent.  Along with the air raids of Operation Menu, aerial mining of Haiphong harbor took place under the code name of Operation Pocket Money. The operation saw 2000lbs of mines dropped in and around the harbor , limiting the DRV’s main harbor for trade of supplies from China and to ports in Cambodia. 
Overall, the American naval power throughout did not see use of its full potential. Due to the limitations of the war’s fighting proximity solely within South Vietnam, it meant that the restricted sea area caused problems in stemming VC and PAVN logistics. Reconnaissance wise, the CNA received and processed a lot of critical information. Yet, it failed to be used fully in practice before 1968. In naval-based amphibious operations, again, there were small successes but in the larger time scale, seemed redundant as holding the points cleared was non-existent.

In Conclusion, the Vietnam War showed the limits the U.S. military had in forms of unchanging strategy and ill-managed tactics. Within the first land war years under LBJ, the failure to tailor the land strategy to coincide with COIN, the U.S. lost valuable numbers, time and support, especially with the addition of the Tet Offensive. Under Nixon, strategy did seem to compliment the North’s actions, however the PAVN changed their way of war that happened to fit America’s initial strategy. In regards to air strategy, U.S. power again was limited to the experiences of strategic bombing seen in Europe, and the adoption of a gradual approach meant a lot of damage dealt to no successful outcomes in the larger scale of things. With Nixon’s swap to a more intrusive and intensive air strategy, coercion seemed more successful in the end, due to the ceasefires and agreement to peace talks.  Again, reflected in the U.S. Naval powers, with the expansion of areas leading to success. Overall, U.S. military powers were limited due to the lack of coherent practical strategy in a limited non-conventional war.
